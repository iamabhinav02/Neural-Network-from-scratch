# Neural-Network-from-scratch

Just a small project for a little hands-on experience on buidling 2-layer Neural Network from scratch using Numpy and then using Tensorflow. Wrote all the codes by myself even the math background was performed and written in my notebook first before implementing them.

Felt good after getting a little hands-on after 4 months.
