# Neural-Network-from-scratch

Just a small project for a little hands-on experience on buidling 2-layer Neural Network from scratch using Numpy and then using Tensorflow and no other libraries was used. Only used scikit-learn and keras to verify with my model acccuracy and thats it. The whole code was written by myself even the math background was performed and written in my notebook first before implementing them.

Felt good after getting a little hands-on after 4 months.
